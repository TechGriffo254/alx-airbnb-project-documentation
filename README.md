# ALX Airbnb Project Documentation

**Project:** Backend Blueprint: Feature Foundations  
**Module:** ALX Airbnb Clone Backend  
**Deadline:** October 27, 2025

## Project Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Airbnb Clone backend application. The documentation covers system architecture, feature specifications, user workflows, data flows, and detailed API requirements—all created before writing a single line of code.

This project simulates the initial phases of a professional software development lifecycle (SDLC), where Product Managers, System Analysts, and Technical Leads collaborate to produce clear specifications and design documents that guide the engineering team.
